# About patching Reddit versions 2024.18.0+
---

Starting from Reddit 2024.18.0, [APKTool does not support decoding due to resource obfuscation](https://github.com/ReVanced/revanced-patches/issues/3099).

Currently, the only workaround is to use ARSCLib to skip decoding of obfuscated resources.

There has been a lot of discussion about ARSCLib support, but currently, ARSCLib support is in the development stage.

Fortunately, I had locally saved the code testing the ARSCLib branch last year, and was able to restore it and prepare a patch targeting Reddit 2024.18.0+.

Currently, only the rvx-builder and CLI support ARSClib. Below are instructions for both.


RVX-Builder (PC)
==

1. Download the [rvx-builder executable](https://github.com/inotia00/rvx-builder/releases/latest) and run it.

2. A GUI will open in your browser. Open the rvx-builder settings and enable the `ARSClib` toggle. Then, click `Home` and patch a Reddit APK. Refer to this [this document](https://github.com/inotia00/revanced-documentation/blob/main/docs/rvx-builder%20(pc).md#using-rvx-builder-windows--macos--linux) for more details.

> [!NOTE]
>
> The `(AUTO SELECTION)` feature does not work when ARSClib is used. Be sure to select a Reddit version that is marked as `(suggested)`.


RVX-Builder (Android - Termux)
==

1. Install rvx-builder in Termux and run it as described in [this document](https://github.com/inotia00/revanced-documentation/blob/main/docs/rvx-builder%20(android).md#installing-rvx-builder-for-the-first-time).

2. A GUI will open in your browser. Open the rvx-builder settings and enable the `ARSClib` toggle. Then, press `Home` and patch a Reddit APK. Refer to this [this document](https://github.com/inotia00/revanced-documentation/blob/main/docs/rvx-builder%20(android).md#using-rvx-builder-termux) for more details.

ReVanced CLI (PC)
==

Download the following packages:

- [ReVanced CLI/ARSCLib](https://github.com/inotia00/revanced-cli-arsclib/releases/latest)
- [ReVanced Patches/ARSCLib](https://github.com/inotia00/revanced-patches-arsclib/releases/latest)
- [ReVanced Integrations](https://github.com/inotia00/revanced-integrations/releases/latest)

(Optional): For simplicity, place the Reddit APK and the packages you downloaded in a single folder.

Using ReVanced CLI (PC)
==

- You can use the option '--rip-lib' to remove unwanted architectures. (e.g. `--rip-lib=x86 --rip-lib=x86_64` ...)
- The option '-l' will show the list of available patches.
- The option '-i' allows you to include patches. (e.g. `-i "Custom branding name for Reddit"` ...)
- The option '-e' allows you to exclude patches. (e.g. `-e "Disable screenshot popup"` ...)

```
java -jar revanced-cli-all.jar \
 -a input.apk \
 -o output-folder \
 -m revanced-integrations.apk \
 --options options.json \
 -b revanced-patches.jar
```

After patching is complete, transfer and install `base.apk` from the ouput directory to your Android device.
