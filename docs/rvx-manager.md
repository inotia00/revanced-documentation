- Read [this document](https://github.com/inotia00/revanced-documentation/blob/main/docs/information-about-patches.md) for information on patches you may want to include or exclude. Otherwise, just click the `Default` button.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For ROOT YouTube / YT Music installations, the `GmsCore support` patch must be excluded. For non-ROOT installations, the patch must be included.

- When satisfied with your patch selection, click the `Done` button, and then the `Patch` button. 


6. Install the patched APK.

> [!TIP]
> For ROOT installations, I recommend also installing the [Detach Magisk module](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/module-detach3-detach-market-links.3447494/). It prevents automatic updates from the Google Play Store, which would cause crashes to occur in the ROOT environment.
